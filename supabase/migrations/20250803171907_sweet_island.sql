  # Fix Admin RLS Policies

  This migration resolves loading issues on admin dashboard pages by:
  
  1. Quote Requests Table
     - Re-enables RLS for proper security
     - Allows anonymous users to insert quote requests (for public submissions)
     - Allows admin users to manage all quote requests (select, insert, update, delete)
  
  2. Equipment Table  
     - Allows public users to read equipment (for browsing catalog)
     - Allows admin users to manage all equipment (select, insert, update, delete)
  
  3. Security
     - Drops conflicting existing policies to start fresh
     - Uses proper admin role checking via profiles table
